## Inspiration
We wanted to make community involvement easy and accessible with a modern feel. Drawing inspiration from websites such as luma, Instagram's feed carousel, and Tinder's swiping animation.

## What it does
JoinUp is an event management platform designed for non-profits and community organizations. It allows participants to quickly check into events using a card swipe, tracks attendance, and connects them with their local communities. Users can explore upcoming events while event organizers can track attendance and foster greater engagement.

## How we built it
For the front-end we utilized Next.js, Typescript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn's UI library. The back-end was done with Supabase for data management and Prisma helped streamline our database interactions.

## Challenges we ran into
We encountered a few key challenges:

- Creating a responsive swiping animation that mimicked a thumb swipe took time to implement.
- Ensuring connection between the front-end and the Supabase back-end.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Managed to bring a real-time event-tracking feature, which could significantly improved event management for non-profits. We feel strongly about supporting our local communities and non-profit organizations.

## What we learned
Through the development of JoinUp, learned about the importance of responsive UI design and the value of real-time databases for creating a good user experience.

## What's next for JoinUp
Introduce features for recurring events and enhanced participant feedback. Improve data visualization tools for event organizers to track long-term community engagement.
